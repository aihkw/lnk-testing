# Description
This repo is an example of why you should NOT run some random files on the internet. The attacker could download additional files on your system and run them in the background without being noticed.
Don't worry, this repo is 100% and just showing you the way how things work. The `main.lnk` file will run a Command Prompt and download `hello.vbs` which shows a friendly pop up message.
